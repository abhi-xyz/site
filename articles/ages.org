* Ages Encription

** Age Command Examples

1. Generate an encrypted file that can be decrypted with a passphrase:

# age --passphrase --output /path/to/encrypted_file /path/to/unencrypted_file

2. Generate a key pair, saving the private key to an unencrypted file and printing the public key to stdout:

# age-keygen --output /path/to/file

3. Encrypt a file with one or more public keys that are entered as literals:

# age --recipient public_key_1 --recipient public_key_2 /path/to/unencrypted_file --output /path/to/encrypted_file

4. Encrypt a file with one or more public keys that are specified in a recipients file:

# age --recipients-file /path/to/recipients_file /path/to/unencrypted_file --output /path/to/encrypted_file

5. Decrypt a file with a passphrase:

# age --decrypt --output /path/to/decrypted_file /path/to/encrypted_file

6. Decrypt a file with a private key file:

# age --decrypt --identity /path/to/private_key_file --output /path/to/decrypted_file /path/to/encrypted_file
