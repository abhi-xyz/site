"Public Administration is concerned with the administration of the government."
*N. Gladden*

*Definition:* Public administration is the effective utilization of men and materials for the implementation of existing laws, governmental policies, programmes and developmental projects.
   
 * In a democracy, it emphasizes serving the people’s needs and ensuring their welfare.

* Importance/ Significants of Public Administration

- Formulate governmental policies
- Provide goods and services
- Ensure welfare of the people
- Findout solutions to public issues

Public administration plays a vital role in implementing policies, providing services, and ensuring the welfare of society. Gandhiji's vision of Grama Swaraj emphasized decentralization and the protection of vulnerable groups, which has deeply influenced India's approach to public administration.

Gandhiji's emphasis on Grama Swaraj shows the importance of local self-governments in making public administration more accessible and effective at the grassroots level.

* Bureaucracy

Bureaucracy is essential for the functioning of public administration, ensuring that government services reach the people efficiently. Bureaucrats, who are the backbone of this system, make decisions, implement policies, and manage day-to-day activities across all levels of government.

*Key Features of Bureaucracy:*

*1) Hierarchical organisation*
 - Bureaucracy is organised in such a way that there is one employee at the top and the number increases when it reaches the lower levels. This is known as hierarchical organisation.

*2) Permanence*
 - Persons appointed will continue in service till the age of retirement.

*3) Appointment on the basis of Qualification*
 - Employees are recruited and appointed on the basis of educational qualification.

*4) Political Neutrality*
 - Bureaucrats are liable to implement the policies of whichever party comes to power. Party interests should not reflect in their work. They should act neutrally.

*5) Professionalism*
 - Every government employee must be skilled in their work.

These features contribute to an efficient public administration system, which is vital for the development of a country.

* Bureaucracy in India

*Recruitment Process:*

The recruitment process in India is primarily conducted through competitive exams, interviews, and screenings. The Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC), as well as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), are responsible for recruiting candidates based on merit. This structured and merit-based system ensures that qualified individuals are appointed to serve in various government departments, contributing to efficient governance.

In India, the civil service is a structured system of government employees who work at various levels, from the central to the state governments and public sector undertakings. These employees play a crucial role in implementing government policies, managing day-to-day operations, and ensuring that public services reach the people effectively.

*State Services*

_Candidates to all India services and central services are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)_. The chairman and the members of this commission are appointed by the President of India. The UPSC has elaborate mechanisms for the recruitment of candidates
based on qualification.

_At the state level, candidates are recruited by the Public Service Commission (PSC)_ of the State. The Governor appoints the Chairman and the members of the State Public Service Commission. UPSC and State PSC’s are constituted on the basis of constitutional provisions. So they are called constitutional institutions.
